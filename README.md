# OOP-with-Java
This repisitory contains my OOP projects with Java.

All comments in the source codes are in Turkish because they were my graduate school's projects.

I am planning to refine my source codes with English comments as soon as possible.

There are 4 projects in this repository:

1. First project is in default folder. There are five methods in the homework1.java. It was my first homework and instructor tested our algorithm skills with this project.

2. The second one is in homework2 folder. It was an inheritance homework. We were given a mix of football, volleyball, and basketball matches and asked for 3 seperate leauge tables as an output.

3. The third one is in homework3 folder. It was an collections homework. We were asked to use 5 different collections to store and print some data.

4. The fourth one is my semester project. It is an exact copy of a "Who Wants To Be A Millioner" tv show. I used all principles of Object Oriented Programming except polymorphism in this project. The data I used is the real questions that are asked in the show's Turkey version. 

If you need more information about my projects or ask something different please do not hesitate to contact with me via e-mail.
